# My Project

Live:

This (ongoing) project is born from a passion for music and language learning. The primary purpose is to create an archive of songs with the original lyrics and translations. It serves as a personal repository for the songs that resonate with me and simultaneously supports my language-learning.

## Features

- **Song Archive**: A collection of Japanese songs with lyrics and translations.
- **Kanji Meaning**: Using the kanjiapi-wrapper library (for kanjiapi.dev), look up the meaning of Kanji characters.

## Technologies Used
